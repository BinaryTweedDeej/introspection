# Pairing Introspection

## Am I denying people the opportunity to learn?

Maybe you're in your comfort zone and being super-productive. If things slow down when you stop driving, maybe that's a sign that your pair could do with more practice.

## Am I coasting too much?

When was the last time I drove? It's not so much about 'doing your fair share' as making sure that you strengthen the right neural pathways to ensure that you really understand what's going on. Could I take over if my pairhad to disappear somewhere?

## Have I checked that my pair really understands what I'm doing?

Is your pair responding with "yeah", "uh-huh", and not a lot else? Maybe they understand enough to tenuously follow what you're doing, but not enough if you asked them to drove.

## Have I spoken up if I don't understand something?

It takes courage to slow someone down and to tell them that you don't understand. Keeping quiet won't make anything better, and the only solution to not understanding something is to take the time to understand it!

## What prompts me to start driving?

Do you always take control after a certain point? Is there a pattern to the parts you take the keyboard for?
