# Stories

Writing good stories is hard.

## Does this story say what a persona can now do?

What is it that the customer can do after the story, that they couldn't do before?

## Does this story have too many deliverables?

In most cases, it's better to have many small specific stories than one that asks you to do three things.

Tell-tale smell: the story has a list of things for you to act upon.

## Is this story specific?

Bad: _Move all the repos from BitBucket to GitHub_
Good: One story for each repo

If a story doesn't say _exactly_ what needs doing, then we can't estimate complexity, and there could be all sorts of assumption hiding, ready to bite us in the backside.

Tell-tale smell: the story mentions an unspecified plural

## Avoid "As a Persona I want..."

If you didn't want it, it wouldn't be in the backlog.

## How should I express my acceptance criteria?

Two common formats which work, depending on context:

- Gherkin language (GIVEN, WHEN, THEN)

This is good when you need to be explicit about the start and end state.

- Explicit list of steps

This is easy for engineers to follow, but requires a more granular level of understanding
